# Spotify Clone

A Spotify Clone built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project gave me a hands-on opportunity to explore key front-end development concepts, such as asynchronous JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and dynamic content rendering.

## Features of the Project:

- **Music Library** – Displays a list of songs dynamically
- **Play/Pause Controls** – Allows seamless playback with next and previous song navigation
- **Custom Seekbar and Volume Control** – Provides a user-friendly music player experience
- **Responsive Design** – Works across different screen sizes
- **Mobile Sidebar Toggle** – Includes a hamburger menu for easy navigation on smaller screens
